/// @brief Count the number of primes <= x using Lehmer's formula.
///        Lehmer's formula is an improved version of Meissel's
///        formula, it adds the P3(x, a) term which is the 3rd partial
///        sieve function and uses y=x^(1/4) instead of x^(1/3).
///
///        Lehmer's formula:
///        pi(x) = pi(y) + phi(x, a) - 1 - P2(x, a) - P3(x, a)
///        with y = x^1/4, a = pi(y)
///
///        Please note that I think that Lehmer's algorithm uses
///        O(x^(3/8)) memory instead of O(x^(1/3) / log(x)) found in
///        many papers. The memory usage is dominated by the segment
///        size (of the segmented sieve of Eratosthenes) in its P2
///        formula, which is O(sqrt(x^(3/4))) = O(x^(3/8)).
///
///        However, our implementation uses O(x^(1/2)) memory instead
///        of O(x^(3/8)) because our phi(x, a) implementation uses a
///        large pi(x) lookup table of size x^(1/2) in order to
///        improve performance.
