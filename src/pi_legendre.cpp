/// @brief Count the number of primes <= x using Legendre's formula.
///        Legendre's prime counting algorithm is the simplest
///        combinatorial algorithm for counting the number of primes.
///        All other formulas (e.g. Meissel's formula, Lehmer's
///        formula, ...) are extensions of Legendre's formula that
///        run faster but are also more complex.
///
///        Legendre's formula:
///        pi(x) = pi(y) + phi(x, pi(y)) - 1
///        with y = x^(1/2)
///
///        Please note that our implementation of Legendre's algorithm
///        uses O(x^(1/2)) memory instead of O(x^(1/2) / log(x)) found
///        in most papers, because our phi(x, a) implementation uses a
///        large pi(x) lookup table of size x^(1/2) in order to
///        improve performance.
