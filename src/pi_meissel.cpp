/// @file  pi_meissel.cpp
/// @brief Count the number of primes <= x using Meissel's formula.
///        Meissel's formula is an improved version of Legendre's
///        formula, it adds the P2(x, a) term which is the 2nd partial
///        sieve function and uses y=x^(1/3) instead of x^(1/2).
///
///        Meissel's formula:
///        pi(x) = pi(y) + phi(x, a) - 1 - P2(x, a)
///        with y = x^1/3, a = pi(y)
///
///        Please note that I think that Meissel's algorithm uses
///        O(x^(1/3)) memory instead of O(x^(1/2) / log(x)) found in
///        many papers. The memory usage is dominated by the segment
///        size (of the segmented sieve of Eratosthenes) in its P2
///        formula, which is O(sqrt(x^(2/3))) = O(x^(1/3)). One does
///        not need to store the primes up to x^(1/2) in P2 (as can be
///        seen in primecount's P2.cpp).
///
///        However, our implementation uses O(x^(1/2)) memory instead
///        of O(x^(1/3)) because our phi(x, a) implementation uses a
///        large pi(x) lookup table of size x^(1/2) in order to
///        improve performance.
