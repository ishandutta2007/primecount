/// The following compile time integer square root function
/// has a recursion depth of O(sqrt(n)). This is very bad, the
/// stack will explose if you try to compute the square root
/// of a number > 10^9. Furthermore constexpr recursion depth
/// is limited by the compiler even more e.g. both GCC and
/// Clang currently limit constexpr recursion depth to 512.
///
/// The nasty thing is that GCC and Clang start calculating
/// constexpr functions at compile time but once the function
/// reaches a recursion depth > 512, GCC and Clang will stop
/// the compile time calculation and instead compute the
/// function at run-time.
///
/// Because of this you cannot easily tell if your constexpr
/// function was evaluated at compile time or at run-time.
/// But you can use static_assert to test whether your constexpr
/// function is calculated at compile time or at runtime.
/// The code below will not compile with the compiler error
/// message telling you the maximum recursion depth has been
/// exceeded.
