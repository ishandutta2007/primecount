///        LLVM/OpenMP dynamic scheduling caused a severe scaling issue
///        in primecount: https://bugs.llvm.org/show_bug.cgi?id=49588
///        By default OpenMP dynamic scheduling may process iterations
///        in random order, it is likely that this causes many cache
///        misses when computing the easy special leaves in primecount.
///        It is possible to use schedule(monotonic:dynamic) to ensure
///        that iterations are processed in sequential order. This
///        seems to fix primecount's scaling issue.
///
///        However as a precaution measure we try to avoid OpenMP
///        dynamic scheduling in primecount and instead implement
///        schedule(monotonic:dynamic, 1) ourselves using relaxed
///        atomics.
